1.HTML-Content .
2.JavaSscript-Behaviour.
3.Reason to add JavaScript at End of body elements
     i.Code is compiled from top to bottom ,therefore first the page content will be loaded before loading JS
     ii.To make sure all the elements in body are rendered by the browser first
     
4.Seperation of Concerns
5.Node Contains JavaScriptEngine so it is same like a browser that executes JS files .
6.Variables used let keyword instead of var ,which came after ES6
